This includes: user creation, asset management and PC imaging along with all software reporting, deployment and patching. Built alert and reporting systems for the monitoring of both network and node health. Problems would trigger alerts, which in turn, trigger solutions. A few example implimentations would be; A network monitoring system (Nagios - Check_MK) to help alert us so we can quickly identify and preemptively troubleshoot remote circuits. A zero-touch and light-touch imaging solution (MDT w/ PXE boot) for automated laptop/desktop deployment via a network connection. A fully automated application deployment system (PDQ Deploy & Inventory) that includes applications updates, Windows patching, inventory and asset reporting.",
