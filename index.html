        <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
            I have a decade of experience as an IT professional. Starting as a retail PC repair tech, before quickly moving through the many levels of enterprise helpdesk support with both medium and large-sized companies. In recent years, I've transitioned into department leadership roles and have loved every minute of it.
        </p>    

        <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
            Due to my obsession for learning and eagerness to understand as much as possible, I've always found myself taking on more roles. Some examples would be: system administration and engineering, analysis in best practices, project management, tool and script making, documentation writing, training, streamlining procedures, along with writing business and project proposals.                
        </p> 
            
        <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">
            My signature for every role I take is to focus on my three favorite things: automate, automating, and automation.   
        </p> 
             
        <p class="color--darkgrey section__description">    
            I recently began focusing my time into more code oriented projects in order to give myself a more rounded skillset and to take my automation skills to a higher level. Although I've found programming to be fun and immensely rewarding, I've always considered it to be a necessary skill due to recent trends in automation and modern IT in general. Even while I was a Windows administrator, it didn't take long for me to find myself writing PowerShell scripts just to make it through the day. This is how I first got my feet wet in the developer world. My educational investment into scripting, along with cloud and web app development, has given me the confidence and ability to not only better discover solutions to business problems, but now the capability to create and implement them myself.
